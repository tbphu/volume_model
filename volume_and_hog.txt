  ### Changeset 1: we model a generic internal osmolarity c_i and Glyc_in is part of the internal osmolarity.
  c_i_0 is vol.c_i_0
  Glyc_in_0  = 10.; # mM
  hog.Glyc_in = Glyc_in_0;
  vol.c_i = c_i_0 - Glyc_in_0; # as this part of c_i, namely Glyc_in is explicitly modeled within the Hog1 model. 

  k_nutrient_0 is vol.k_nutrient_0
  vol.k_nutrient = k_nutrient_0 - hog.k_Glyc_s0;

  glycerol_correction_factor = Glyc_in_0/c_i_0;
  hog.Acc:   => hog.Glyc_in; cyto*glycerol_correction_factor*hog.k_Glyc_s0;
  #hog.k_Glyc_s1   = glycerol_correction_factor*56140* 1e-3 / 60;   #mM per sec
 
  vol.pi_i := (vol.c_i + hog.Glyc_in + hog.Pbs2 + hog.Pbs2PP + hog.Hog1c + hog.Hog1PPc + hog.Hog1n + hog.Hog1PPn + hog.Yt) * vol.R * vol.T; 


  ### Changeset 2: Following adjustments were made due to updated turgor value, which is lower: 200kPa and the low Young's modulus
  hog.alpha       = 0.18 * 1e6; # original value from zhike was: 0.398 * 1e6
  hog.gamma       = 0.18 * 1e6; # originial value from zhike 0.9626 * 1e6

  #hog.beta   = 0.4;   #mM per sec

  hog.hill_exponent = 48; # original value from zhike was: 8
  hog.hill_exponent_eflux = 48;  # original value from zhike was: 12
